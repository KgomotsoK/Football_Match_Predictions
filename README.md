# Football_Match_Predictions

## Description
- This was a quite ambitous project,
- Imagine you could know the results of your favourite Premier league team before they even play,
- You can place a bet, brag to your friends and so on..
- This was a lousy attempt at just that, with a better dataset we could've been bit closer.
- Although football is a game of chance, with the available training data, this model seem to have performed very admirably.
- Yes we could do more to improve it and in due moment.

 ## The model prints out report at the end.

 ## Points to note
 - The results block is coded with:
     - 0 ~ for loss
     - 1 ~ for draw
     - 2 ~ for win
